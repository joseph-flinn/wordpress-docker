## Wordpress Docker Compose

This is a docker compose setup for building or working on wordpress sites by 
using docker. It is a very simple setup that does not include things like a
separate webserver container or a letsencrypt container to be a production level
project. THIS IS FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY!!
